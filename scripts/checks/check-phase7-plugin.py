"""Checked-in Phase 7 Local App MCP contract gate.

This source gate complements the Rust tests with cheap checks for the
security-sensitive seams that must not silently regress: connection-scoped
identity, one physical hub, active-catalog freshness, bounded exposure, and
redacted/cancellable calls.
