//! "this plan is approved": the success branch of the plan-exit tool, which only
//! runs after the user answered the approval prompt. The host feeds that tool's
//! result payload (`{plan, filePath, isAgent, …}`) to [`PlanApprovalLog::observe`]
//! and the service reads the record back when a plan is turned into a prepared
